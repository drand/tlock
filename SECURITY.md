## Security Announcements

[Join the drand slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/drandworkspace/shared_invite/zt-19u4rf6if-bf7lxIvF2zYn4~TrBwfkiA) for security and vulnerability announcements.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find any vulnerabilities, please disclose them via email to security@protocol.ai or to a Protocol Labs member on [our slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/drandworkspace/shared_invite/zt-19u4rf6if-bf7lxIvF2zYn4~TrBwfkiA).

Also feel free to timelock encrypt them for a reasonable disclosure period and post the ciphertext publicly to force us to fix them in a timely manner ;)
