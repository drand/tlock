## tlock: Timelock Encryption/Decryption Made Practical

tlock gives you time based encryption and decryption capabilities by relying on a [drand](https://drand.love/) threshold network.  
It's also a Go library, which is used to implement the `tle` command line tool enabling anybody to leverage timelock encryption.

Our timelock encryption system relies on an "[unchained drand network](https://drand.love/blog/2022/02/21/multi-frequency-support-and-timelock-encryption-capabilities/)".

Working endpoints to access it are, on mainnet:
- https://api.drand.sh/ (US)
- https://api2.drand.sh/ (EU)
- https://api3.drand.sh/ (Asia)
- https://drand.cloudflare.com/ (load-balanced across regions)

On mainnet, the only chainhash supporting timelock encryption, with a 3s frequency and signatures on the G1 group is:
`dbd506d6ef76e5f386f41c651dcb808c5bcbd75471cc4eafa3f4df7ad4e4c493`

This is a production-ready network with high-availability guarantees. It is considered fully secure by the drand team 
and ran by the same League of Entropy that has been running drand in production since 2019.

On testnet:
- https://pl-us.testnet.drand.sh/
- https://pl-eu.testnet.drand.sh/
- https://testnet0-api.drand.cloudflare.com/
where we have two networks supporting timelock:
- running with a 3 seconds frequency with signatures on G1: `f3827d772c155f95a9fda8901ddd59591a082df5ac6efe3a479ddb1f5eeb202c`
- running with a 3 seconds frequency with signatures on G2: `7672797f548f3f4748ac4bf3352fc6c6b6468c9ad40ad456a397545c6e2df5bf`
Note these are relying on the League of Entropy **Testnet**, which should not be considered secure.

You can also spin up a new drand network and run your own, but note that the security guarantees boil down to the trust you have in your network.

### Install or Build the CLI

This tool is pure Go, it works without CGO (`CGO_ENABLED=0`)

```bash
go install github.com/drand/tlock/cmd/tle@latest
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drand/tlock
go build cmd/tle/tle.go
```

---

### CLI Usage

```
Usage:
	tle [--encrypt] (-r round)... [--armor] [-o OUTPUT] [INPUT]
	tle --decrypt [-o OUTPUT] [INPUT]

Options:
	-e, --encrypt  Encrypt the input to the output. Default if omitted.
	-d, --decrypt  Decrypt the input to the output.
	-n, --network  The drand API endpoint to use.
	-c, --chain    The chain to use. Can use either beacon ID name or beacon hash. Use beacon hash in order to ensure public key integrity.
	-r, --round    The specific round to use to encrypt the message. Cannot be used with --duration.
	-f, --force    Forces to encrypt against past rounds.
	-D, --duration How long to wait before the message can be decrypted.
	-o, --output   Write the result to the file at path OUTPUT.
	-a, --armor    Encrypt to a PEM encoded format.

If the OUTPUT exists, it will be overwritten.

NETWORK defaults to the drand mainnet endpoint https://api.drand.sh/.

CHAIN defaults to the chainhash of the fastnet network:
dbd506d6ef76e5f386f41c651dcb808c5bcbd75471cc4eafa3f4df7ad4e4c493

You can also use the drand test network:
https://pl-us.testnet.drand.sh/
and its unchained network with chain hash 7672797f548f3f4748ac4bf3352fc6c6b6468c9ad40ad456a397545c6e2df5bf
Note that if you encrypted something prior to March 2023, this was the only available network and used to be the default.

DURATION, when specified, expects a number followed by one of these units:
"ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h", "d", "M", "y".

Example:
    $ tle -D 10d -o encrypted_file data_to_encrypt

After the specified duration:
    $ tle -d -o dencrypted_file.txt encrypted_file
```

#### Time Lock Encryption

Files can be encrypted using a duration (`--duration/-D`) in which the `encrypted_data` can be decrypted.

Example using the testnet network and a duration of 5 seconds:
```bash
$ tle -n="https://pl-us.testnet.drand.sh/" -c="7672797f548f3f4748ac4bf3352fc6c6b6468c9ad40ad456a397545c6e2df5bf" -D=5s -o=encrypted_data data.txt
```

If a round (`--round/-R`) number is known, it can be used instead of the duration. The data can be decrypted only when that round becomes available in the network.

Example using the fastnet mainnet network and a given round:
```bash
$ tle -n="https://api.drand.sh/" -c="dbd506d6ef76e5f386f41c651dcb808c5bcbd75471cc4eafa3f4df7ad4e4c493" -r=123456 -o=encrypted_data data.txt
```

It is also possible to encrypt the data to a PEM encoded format using the armor (`--armor/-a`) flag,
and to rely on the default network and chain hash (which is the `fastnet` one on `api.drand.sh`):
```bash
$ tle -a -D 20s -o=encrypted_data.PEM data.txt
```

#### Time Lock Decryption

For decryption, it's only necessary to specify the network if you're not using the default one.

Using the default ("fastnet" network on mainnet) and printing on stdout:
```bash
$ tle -d encrypted_data
```

Using the old testnet unchained network and storing the output in a file named "decrypted_data":
```bash
$ tle -d -n="https://pl-us.testnet.drand.sh/" -c="7672797f548f3f4748ac4bf3352fc6c6b6468c9ad40ad456a397545c6e2df5bf"
 -o=decrypted_data encrypted_data
```
Note it will overwrite the `decrypted_data` file if it already exists.

If decoding an armored source you don't need to specify `-a` again.

### Library Usage

These example show how to use the API to time lock encrypt and decrypt data.

#### Time Lock Encryption

```go
// Open an io.Reader to the data to be encrypted.
in, err := os.Open("data.txt")
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalf("open: %s", err)
	return
}
defer in.Close()

// Construct a network that can talk to a drand network. Example using the mainnet fastnet network.
// host:      "https://api.drand.sh/"
// chainHash: "dbd506d6ef76e5f386f41c651dcb808c5bcbd75471cc4eafa3f4df7ad4e4c493"
network := http.NewNetwork(host, chainHash)

// Specify how long we need to wait before the file can be decrypted.
duration := 10 * time.Second

// Use the network to identify the round number that represents the duration.
roundNumber, err := network.RoundNumber(time.Now().Add(duration))
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalf("round by duration: %s", err)
	return
}

// Write the encrypted file data to this buffer.
var cipherData bytes.Buffer

// Encrypt the data for the given round.
if err := tlock.New(network).Encrypt(&cipherData, in, roundNumber); err != nil {
	log.Fatalf("encrypt: %v", err)
	return
}
```

#### Time Lock Decryption

```go
// Open an io.Reader to the data to be decrypted.
in, err := os.Open("data.tle")
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalf("open: %v", err)
	return
}
defer in.Close()

// Construct a network that can talk to a drand network.
// host:      "https://api.drand.sh/"
// chainHash: "dbd506d6ef76e5f386f41c651dcb808c5bcbd75471cc4eafa3f4df7ad4e4c493"
network := http.NewNetwork(host, chainHash)

// Write the decrypted file data to this buffer.
var plainData bytes.Buffer

// Decrypt the data. If you try to decrypt the data *before* the specified
// duration, it will fail with the message: "too early to decrypt".
if err := tlock.New(network).Decrypt(&plainData, in); err != nil {
	log.Fatalf("decrypt: %v", err)
	return
}
```

### Applying another layer of encryption

The recommended way of doing "hybrid" encryption where you both encrypt your data using timelock encryption, but also with another encryption scheme, such as a public-key or a symmetric-key scheme is to simple re-encrypt your encrypted data using tlock.

For example, you can use the [age](https://github.com/FiloSottile/age) cli to encrypt your data with a passphrase as follows.

#### Encrypting Data With Passphrase
```bash
$ cat data.txt | age -p | tle -D 30s -o encrypted_data
```

#### Decrypting Data With Passphrase
```bash
$ cat encrypted_data | tle -d | age -d -o data.txt
```

Note that you could do the same with PGP or any other encryption tool.

### Security considerations

Currently, this is relying on the League of Entropy **Testnet**, which should not be considered secure. 
A compatible League of Entropy Mainnet network is going to be launched in mid September, which can be considered secure.

The security of our timelock encryption mechanism relies on four main things:
- The security of the underlying [Identity Encryption Scheme](https://crypto.stanford.edu/~dabo/pubs/papers/bfibe.pdf) (proposed in 2001) and [its implementation](https://github.com/drand/kyber/blob/a780ab21355ebe7f60b441a586d5e73a40c564eb/encrypt/ibe/ibe.go#L39-L47) that we're using.
- The security of the [threshold BLS scheme](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00145-004-0314-9.pdf) (proposed in 2003), and [its impementation](https://github.com/drand/kyber/blob/master/sign/tbls/tbls.go) by the network you're relying on.
- The security of [age](https://age-encryption.org/)'s underlying primitives, and that of the [age implementation](https://age-encryption.org/) we're using to encrypt the data, since we rely on the [hybrid encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_cryptosystem) principle, where we only timelock encrypt ("wrap") a random symmetric key that is used by age to actually symmetrically encrypt the data using [Chacha20Poly1305](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8439)).  
- The security of the threshold network providing you with its BLS signatures **at a given frequency**, for instance the default for `tle` is to rely on drand and its existing League of Entropy network. 
 
In practice this means that if you trust there are never more than the threshold `t` malicious nodes on the network you're relying on, you are guaranteed that you timelocked data cannot be decrypted earlier than what you intended. 

Please note that neither BLS nor the IBE scheme we are relying on are "quantum resistant", therefore shall a Quantum Computer be built that's able to threaten their security, our current design wouldn't resist. There are also no quantum resistant scheme that we're aware of that could be used to replace our current design since post-quantum signatures schemes do not "thresholdize" too well in a post-quantum IBE-compatible way. 

However, such a quantum computer seems unlikely to be built within the next 5-10 years and therefore we currently consider that you can expect a "**long term security**" horizon of at least 5 years by relying on our design.
